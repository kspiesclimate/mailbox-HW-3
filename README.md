# mailbox-HW-3

This hw was to create the MailBox App. I spent about 6 hours on this homework.

Everything should be working, including all optionals except for "shake to undo"

In the mailbox app, you can:
1. scroll through your messages
2. archive, delete message on swipe
3. mark as later or list on swipe
4. compose a new message
5. view the menu screen
